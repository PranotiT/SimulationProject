# SimulationProject
The projects aims to create a simulation for an artistic work we might want to create in the real world. The goal of the simulation is to get a deeper understanding of the proposed work when it will be executed in real world.

The simulation is developed using Processing.

This project simulates an idea for an art installation. The art installation involves playing the old Nokia "Snake game" on a large screen/floor in a room, where the people moving in a room control the snake. The basic snake game will be built on to eventually have more effects generated by the people in the room.

People moving around a large space (such as an art museum) can activate proximity sensors to control the snake being played on a large screen in the room.
